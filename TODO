TODO:

- Rails helpers:
  Probably similar to Helpers::Merb. I just don't use Rails enough right now to
  work through it.

- Check for dependencies:
  When, for example, Paginate::DM is extended into a class, verify that dm-core
  and dm-aggregates are loaded. This would give me more timely errors than
  finding out when #paginate is first called.
  
- Generic ORM module:
  If dependencies are checked for, this would allow a way to use Paginators::ORM
  through a module without the dependency check.

- Includes for ORM collections:
  For example:
  
      DataMapper::Collection.__send__(:include, Paginate::DM)
      
  What's the best way to do this?
  Something similar for AR?
  Maybe Paginate::auto_includes which would include such as the above
